Vocababulary-Database 
=======

Vocabulary-Database is a tool for looking up definitions of words and storing their meanings in a local database.

Vocabulary-Database uses the sqlite3 module to create a place to store all the vocabulary words and definitions
you want.  

There a couple of extra modules used that aren't part of the python standard lib.

You can grab a copy of mechanize from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mechanize/ and 
BeautifulSoup from http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/.

For the database files you will need to edit the paths to your user's home directory on your system or you
will get an error about 'No such file or directory'(unless haumea is your systems name).
