Vocababulary-Database 
=======

Vocabulary-Database is a tool for looking up definitions of words and storing their meanings in a local database.

Vocabulary-Database uses the sqlite3 module to create a place to store all the vocabulary words and definitions
you want.  

There a couple of extra modules used that aren't part of the python standard lib.

You can grab a copy of mechanize from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mechanize/ and 
BeautifulSoup from http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/.

For the database files, they will be saved as a '.' file to your user's home directory on your system.  
If you 'dump' that database it will be saved as a 'txt' file in your user's home directory on your system.
